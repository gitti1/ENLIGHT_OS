# Results from the survey on data management and FAIR data

In this section, we summarise further information on RDM which was collected in November 2021 in advance of a FAIRsFAIR event at which ENLIGHT RISEâ€™s activities and plans were presented. We investigated in more detail the status of RDM policies at ENLIGHT institutions as well as if they cover core aspects such as FAIRness and data sharing.

There were eleven responses to the survey on data management and FAIR data. In two instances there were two responses, in these cases the response which provided more detailed information was used. All respondent names were removed in the final dataset.
